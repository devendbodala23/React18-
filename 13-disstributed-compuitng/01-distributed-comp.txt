						 Distributed Computing
- Distributed computing allows communication between two different applications running on two different machines.
- It is also about the communication between two different objects running in two different process of same machine.
- To build distributed applications various distributed technologies are required.
- Some of the popular distributed technologies are

			CORBA			Common Object Request Broken Architecture
			DCOM			Distribute Component Object Model
			RMI				Remote Method Invocation
			EJB				Enterprise Java Beans
			Web Service
			Remoting 
			etc..

- Web Service is one of the popular distributed computing technology known to all software systems like Java, .NET, PHP, Python etc..

Issues with Web Service: 
- It can use only SOAP as specification.
- It can run only on web server.
- It can use only "http" as protocol

Web Service Specifications:
a) SOAP
b) REST
c) JSON

SOAP 
- Service Oriented Architecture Protocol
- Consumer sends an XML request

	<Products>
		<Product>
		   <Id>1</Id>
		</Product>
	</Products>

- Provides sends an XML response
	<Products>
	    	<Product>
			<Id>1</Id>
			<Name>TV</Name>
			<Price>34000</Price>
		</Product>
	</Products>

REST
- Representational State Transfer
- Consumer sends a query request

	http://server.com/products?id=1

- Provider sends XML or JSON response. 

	{
	  "Id":1,
	 "Name": "TV",
	 "Price": 34000.44
	}

JSON
- JavaScript Object Notation
- Consumer sends a JSON request.
- Provider sends JSON response.


						        Web API
- Application Programming Interface 
- API provides a programming interface that handles communication in distributed applications.
- It is intention is to make the data available to any OS service and any Device.
- Features
	a) It uses REST & JSON
	b) It can run on any server
	c) It can use any protocol
	d) Light weight
	e) Modular
	f) Faster
